This is an RSI-based bot. It gets a buy signal when the RSI goes out of the oversold region and a sell signal when the RSI goes out of the overbought region.

All transactions are done at the market price with the size specified.

When first launched the bot sends a message in Telegram with the information on the position. It keeps reporting on the program operation and position changes in standalone mode.

The program also saves its logs in a separate file.
